VolSched -- An Online Volunteer Scheduler
-----------------------------------------

VolSched is an online application for scheduling volunteers to work at events.
A hosted version is available at http://www.volsched.com.

VolSched uses the Django framework (http://www.djangoproject.com/).  The current
version relies on the (old) version 0.96.  To deploy it as-is, you will need this
version of Django.

To get it working, you need to set up a database for VolSched to use, then run
./manage.py syncdb .  Then you can set up your web server to run VolSched using
FastCGI, as described at
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/fastcgi/ .
